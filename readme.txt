Frizzly allows you to add share buttons on images and in post content.

== Description ==
If you use many different plugins to add social media share buttons to your website, most likely each plugin has its own images and your website looks inconsistent. Frizzly is here to fix that. Frizzly allows you to share your posts on multiple social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin and more. You can easily choose on which pages the share buttons should show up and where they should be placed.

Features:

* add share icons before and after the content of your posts
* add share icons over images (especially useful for websites that use images extensively)
* choose only share buttons that you need
* don't show share buttons on certain pages (e.g. your home page)

== Changelog ==

= 1.1.1 =
* Released 2026-08-09
* Security: fixed a reflected cross-site scripting issue in the admin notice shown when no modules are active (CVE-2025-30554). The notice's dismiss link was built from the current request URI; it now uses an explicit admin URL.
* Security: escaped the Open Graph and Twitter meta tags added to the site head, which previously output post-specific social settings unescaped.
* Security: escaped all output on the post editor's Frizzly meta box and sanitised those fields on save.
* Security: the settings screen now validates the requested tab against the registered tabs instead of trusting the query string.
* Security: hardened the share-by-email endpoint (missing post check, sender domain no longer derived from the Host header).
* Hardening: translated strings used as inline templates in the settings screen are sanitised and no longer evaluated as AngularJS expressions.
